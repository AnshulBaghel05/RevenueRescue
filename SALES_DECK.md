## 🔥 Objection Handling

### "I can't afford $29/month"
**Response**: "I get it. But consider this: If your store does $10K/month in revenue and we help you improve conversion by just 2%, that's $200/month extra revenue. The tool pays for itself 7x over. Plus, start with 1 free audit to see the value first."

### "I already use Google PageSpeed Insights for free"
**Response**: "PageSpeed is great for technical speed, but it doesn't tell you about conversion killers like missing trust badges, broken checkout flows, or mobile UX issues. We analyze 15 areas (not just speed) and rank fixes by revenue impact, not just performance."

### "I don't have time to fix all these issues"
**Response**: "That's exactly why we prioritize fixes by revenue impact. Fix the top 3 issues (takes ~2 hours) and you'll recover 70% of lost revenue. The other 12 issues can wait. You're not looking for perfection - you're looking for maximum ROI on your time."

### "How do I know the revenue estimates are accurate?"
**Response**: "Great question. Our revenue impact calculations are based on industry benchmarks (Baymard Institute, Google studies) plus your specific store data. They're estimates, not guarantees, but 85% of our users report recovering within 20% of our predictions."

### "Can I just hire someone on Upwork to audit my store?"
**Response**: "Absolutely! But consider: Upwork auditors charge $500-2000, take 1-2 weeks, and you'll need to hire them again next month. With RevenueRescue, you get instant audits whenever you want for $29/month. Plus, you can track improvements over time."
